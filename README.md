# Image-Segmentation-using-active-contours
INTRODUCTION

In this Project I am trying to implement active contours algorithm for character segmentation. Generally active contours are used in the medical field to segement any desired part X-Ray or CEG. Since most of the desired part of these images are smooth we get a very accurate segemented output which is used for other downstream tasks. However, I tried to implement the same algorithm to see how this algorithm works for images have sharp edges.
